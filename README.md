# Roller.io-
‚Ä¢) Introducing: Roller.io ‚öæ

I am excited to share Roller.io. A dynamic and engaging game developed as an individual learning project. This journey was an incredible blend of creativity, coding, and the love for game development.
 
‚Ä¢) Overviews :
Roller.io is an attractive parkour game in which the user controls a ball as it moves through tight levels. The goal may seem simple, but it sure is fun: to be able to push the sphere all the way to the end of the level for each level.
 
3 Complex and engaging learning basis levels available.
 
The level restarts if it rolls off the platform and continues until the sphere reaches the finish line.

‚Ä¢) Technologies used here are:
Unity : Development of the game
C#: Scripting, logics, etc.

‚Ä¢) Learning Experience:
This is just an educational project. On this journey, I learned a lot about game development, coding, and asset management. Some components and assets used in this game are not owned by me.

‚Ä¢) Future Plans:
This is my first game and I am excited to create more games with more features and share my progress on LinkedIn. Stay tuned!
